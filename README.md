PringleCV
==========

An OpenCV-based computer vision application inspired by ReacTIVision.

PringleCV was designed for students of UQ's *CSSE3010 - Embedded Systems Design & Interfacing* course. It enables them to view, track and localise a painted, labelled can (mounted on a rover vehicle) in 3D space using a single, low-cost webcam. Telemetry is available to external agents via a local Mosquitto server (MQTT) and UDP broadcast.
