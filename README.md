PringleCV
=============

An OpenCV-based computer vision application inspired by ReacTIVision. 

PringleCV assists viewing, tracking and localising a painted / labelled can in 3D space using a single, low-cost webcam. Telemetry is available to external agents via a local Mosquitto server (MQTT) and UDP broadcast.
